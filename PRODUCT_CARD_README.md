- Maintains consistent aspect ratios

### Typography Scaling
- Responsive font sizes using Bootstrap's typography scale
- Proper line heights for readability
- Truncation with tooltips for long product names

### Touch Interactions
- Larger touch targets on mobile devices
- Improved button spacing for finger navigation
- Accessible focus states for keyboard navigation

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### State Management
